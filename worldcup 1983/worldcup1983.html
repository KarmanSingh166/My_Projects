        <summary>Origin</summary>
            <p>A film based on the 1983 Cricket World Cup and India's win at the tournament was announced on mid-July 2016,[9] with the rights for the production being purchased by Phantom Films — a joint production company owned by Madhu Mantena, featuring the collaborations of directors Anurag Kashyap, Vikas Bahl and Vikramaditya Motwane.[33] Vishnu Vardhan Induri, the founder and managing director of Celebrity Cricket League, also expressed his interest in co-producing the film, citing his passion for cricket.[34][35] It is touted to be the first venture of his newly formed production house, Vibri Media.[34] The squad members of the 1983 team, along with former Indian cricketer Kapil Dev met the producers at a suburban hotel in Mumbai, discussing about the film.[9] In the process, the two production companies had signed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the 1983 team to make an official biopic, where according to the norms, the producers will get to use the actual names of the players as well as use real incidents from their lives. In an official statement regarding the biopic, Dev stated that "the journey of the 1983 team is a story of inspiration which proves that one can achieve anything if they aim for it and work for it no matter what the world thinks"</p>

            <p>Despite the official announcement, the makers were yet to finalise the cast and crew members and the director of the project. Rumours surfaced that Kabir Khan will direct the project and either Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor or Sushant Singh Rajput will play the role of Kapil Dev.[36][37] When Khan was asked about his role in the biopic, he stated that "he was fascinated on the story of India's journey at the 1983 Cricket World Cup" but remained silent on the claims of directing the film.[38] Akshay Kumar was also rumoured to act in the film, which was later declined.[39] On 25 September 2017, Phantom Films announced that Singh would play the role of Kapil Dev,[40] and Kabir Khan too confirmed that he will direct the film.[41]

As a young schoolboy when I watched India win the 1983 Cricket World Cup. I had no idea that from that day onwards cricket in India will change forever. As a filmmaker, for me, the journey to that win, filled with raw energy and sheer passion of that young Indian team, is probably one of the most exciting stories I have worked on.

— Kabir Khan, on directing the film[42]
A launch event was hosted at JW Marriott Mumbai on 27 September 2017 by Reliance Entertainment and Vibri Media to announce the biopic officially under the title 83.[43][44] Singh and the entire former team that won the Cricket World Cup in 1983 were present at the event.[45] Speaking at the event, Khan said that the makers will begin pre-production and location scouting by late-November 2017, and has planned to shoot the film in real locations, in order to create authenticity and also "to give youngsters to celebrate the milestone in the history of Indian Cricket which happened when many were not even born".[43]

This film was considered to be one of the last productions of Phantom Films,[46] the other being Super 30 (2019) and Ghoomketu (2020). The company dissolved in October 2018 after its response to a sexual assault allegation on Bahl by a former women employee of the company,[47] and its collaborators later moved to work on independent projects.[47] Bahl was ousted from the project.[48] In May 2019, Sajid Nadiadwala joined the film as one of the co-producers</p>
